# Color Primaries

This section enters the first of three settings that are important for retaining accurate color when encoding videos, those settings being primaries, color matrix, and transfer characteristics.

Color primaries are used to indicate the correct coordinates for the red, blue, and green colors. There are historical reasons for [why so many standards exist](https://xkcd.com/927/), and this guide will not go in depth into history lessons, but will explain what primaries are available and when to use each one.

Note that for primaries, matrices, and transfer, you can view the values that are set on a video using a tool like [MediaInfo](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo). If there are no values set, the renderer will need to guess which values to use. A safe default assumption for most modern videos is BT.709, although this may vary depending on source and resolution for the video. It is strongly preferred to set the correct values when encoding.

Each setting has at least one name and exactly one integer value representing it--most encoder softwares will accept one or more of the names, but some tooling such as Vapoursynth and MKVToolnix accepts the integer values instead.

In case no color primaries are specified, `mpv` uses the following heuristics:

```
if matrix == "BT.2020" {
    "BT.2020"
} else if matrix == "BT.709" {
    "BT.709"
} else if width >= 1280 || height > 576 {
    "BT.709"
} else if height == 576 {
    "BT.470BG"
} else if height == 480 || height == 488 {
    "SMPTE 170M"
} else {
    "BT.709"
}
```

### BT.709

BT.709 is the standard used for modern high-definition video, and is a safe default assumption.

### BT.470M

BT.470M is a standard that was used in analog television systems in the United States.

### Film

The White point used by color film is Standard Illuminant C (??? I'm not sure if this makes any sense whatsoever).

### BT.2020

BT.2020 is a standard used for ultra-high-definition video, i.e. 4K and higher. It may be used with or without HDR, as HDR is defined by the transfer characteristics.

These color primaries are used in the following standards:

### DCI-P3

DCI-P3 is a wide-gamut colorspace used alongside RGB. It is used internally by most HDR monitors on the market.

### Display-P3

Display-P3 is a variant of DCI-P3 developed by Apple because they wanted to be different.

### EBU Tech 3213

EBU Tech 3213 is a standard for studio monitors, apparently. It is used in the following standard:

- [EBU Tech 3213](https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3213.pdf) (duh)

The color primaries specified by EBU Tech 3213 are the same as BT.470BG. It uses the D65 white point
as well.
